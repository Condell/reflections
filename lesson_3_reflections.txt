When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working from another computer, of it someone else is working on a project with you.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If git stayed up to date, you might pull things you dont want.
